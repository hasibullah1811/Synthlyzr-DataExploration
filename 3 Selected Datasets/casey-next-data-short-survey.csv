For those working in the city the travel times can take up to two ours and this creates a lot of frustration. In one word commuting to the City and back is a nightmare. When we are coming back from work we want to get back to our families earlier and not having a reliable transport ads additional stress in our lives.

We need more bus routes that connect to the stations, especially for Narre Warren North. We need a few buses that go direct to the station in the morning on Belgrave hallam road. This would reduce the need for cars on the road during peak hour and a reduction in cars parked at hallam station.","Allow for more community programmes that help foster better relationships with our environment - empowering urban farming (as most people have the space to do this), creating food waste bins as well as landfill and recycling bins, preserve as much land as possible.

"I would like to see Casey as a pleasant place to live, with open spaces, trees and parks. These are the things that draw people to a place to live , to create a community where people want to belong. Unfortunately, as suburbs grow, sometimes councils forget what attracts people to an area, and the character of an area is lost, never to be reclaimed.","Overdevelopment, Already the drive into Berwick is already beginning to look like an industrial estate. This is a great pity, as it has always been a town with a village feel that has been attractive to residents and visitors a like. A town with a welcome look with its trees and village feel. Lets claw back some of that welcome feel by keeping it green with tree planting , more parks and open spaces with wider set-backs for houses and nature strips.

Senior citizens clubs in casey go to expensive places that the average pensioner can't afford. 

Would be great to have a morning coffee meet up for over 60s. Thus would be great. Greater access to information for elderly and vulnerable about where the council is, what services are running - current do not know how to access this. 

A bus that elderly people pay a dollar to go on and be taken for a lunch to meet people. 


It is important for elderly people to be able to mix.

Rooming house needs upgrading and cleaning out of the drugs. Fairly nice area it is well maintained. 

 A lot of activities for people who need physical support. I.e disabled needs to be affordable - concessions for people with disabilities. 


The information for supporting people with disabilities is on and off. You get an influx of information then other times you can't find any. Help with accomodation etc. websites are a good way to find information and a central information centre. 

 Looking for long period stay. Hard to find ways to move, cheaper ways to move.

Currently have to find services driving around to physically spot services.

More disabled parking would be much better. Not enough often to only  have two spots.

"I would like Casey to be a safe and productive where technology is common rather than a struggle. 
However, in the last 3 years Casey is nothing of this type. Most people are scared in their homes because they don't know when someone they do not know will enter even if they don't wish them to. Further, since we've lived here - over 15 years now - our internet connection has only gotten worse and not better. Then when we thought we were going to be joining at least the 21st century with our connection, we have now gotten shuffled off the list and we're stuck with an internet connection which you can barely use and forget any kind of streaming service. In order to be a productive and technology updated area, Casey (Springvale ward) isn't even able to cope in 2016, so I doubt by 2041 things will change. ","This is a hard question to answer as there is so much in Casey that needs to be looked at - traffic congestion, employment, computer connections, safety, and a council and MP who cares for the entire area and not just areas where they are worried about not getting votes. 
According to the overall question, if I had to pick just one area I am the most concerned with it would be how the current council and state MP centre on areas where they do not think they will not get votes to get back into office. Further, to hold as many closed door meetings as this council does, according to the minutes of the council that I have been reading, each session has a lengthy section of time during each meeting which is closed and away from the public. To me, as a ratepayer, I feel that we should not have things that are hidden away like dirty laundry.

I think the opportunity to have amenity and work opportunities within the municipality. Idea of having to travel out of town is dreadful. Encouraging businesses that employ others in the community would be valuable. Big believer in the value of having attractive places/areas. Parks encourage people to get out and meet each other. Travelling libraries  once a week or month would help for people who dont have cars

What attracted you to Casey? 

The Mariot waters estate. I dont drive and I can walk to the shops and it is close to my daughter who has just had a baby.
As we are maturing in age it is good as it is not too hilly and the Mariot water estate is fairly flat. Opposite a council park. Keen for council to put some amenities.","FUTURE RESIDENT
